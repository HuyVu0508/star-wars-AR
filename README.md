# The Empire Invasion - an AR experience
The Empire force with the grand Star Destroyer suddenly teleports to my own bed room! Where should I run?!
This is my first AR experience created using Facebook Spark, a very convinient and useful enough tools to make interesting experimental AR prototypes. 
In this project, I mainly test my story-telling ability through designs and animations. I think it's cool to experience something extraordinary as Starwars and AR in our own familiar bedroom.

The experience starts when user head the phone to the following target image. It is the a painting hung in my bedroom that I took a picture with my phone to make the target image for initializing the animation:
