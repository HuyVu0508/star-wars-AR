# The Empire Invasion - an AR experience
The Empire force with the grand Star Destroyer suddenly teleports to my own bed room! Where should I run?!
This is my first AR experience created using Facebook Spark, a very convinient and useful enough tools to make interesting experimental AR prototypes. 
In this project, I mainly test my story-telling ability through designs and animations. I think it's cool to experience something extraordinary as Starwars and AR in our own familiar bedroom.
